With year-round warmth and humidity, ant colonies thrive in condos, houses, and commercial buildings across the city. From Sukhumvit to Silom, ant infestations are one of the most common pest complaints we receive.</p><p class=\"tr\">Ants enter through the tiniest cracks — around pipes, door frames, and window seals. Once a scout ant finds food, it leaves a pheromone trail that guides hundreds more into your kitchen, pantry, and dining areas. Traditional chemical sprays only kill the ants you see, while the colony of thousands continues to grow behind your walls.</p>",
