# Bangkok Junk — Site Build Plan
**Domain:** bangkokjunk.com  
**Platform:** Biznitos  
**Languages:** English (primary) + Thai

## Brand Context

Bangkok Junk is an English-language, Bangkok-focused junk removal brand. It sits within a portfolio of Biznitos-owned service sites (khunclean.com, naturalpestcontrolbkk.com, thaikru.com). The goal is to dominate search results for junk and item removal in Bangkok across multiple domains. Each domain targets distinct keyword clusters and audiences.

**Property types served:**
Approximately 75% condos and apartments, 25% houses, townhouses, and shophouses. Shophouse and house jobs tend to be larger and higher ticket. Language throughout the site should reflect all property types naturally — avoid being condo-centric. Use "home," "property," or "space" as the default neutral term. Mention condos, houses, townhouses, and shophouses explicitly where relevant so all customers feel seen.

**Primary audiences:**
- **The Upgrader** — replacing a sofa, fridge, mattress, or AC. Needs the old item gone fast. Coordinates around new delivery. Price-aware.
- **The Overwhelmed** — accumulated junk, moving out, leaving Thailand, full clearout needed. Not price sensitive. Needs reassurance, not judgment.

---

## Tone & Messaging

- Confident, friendly, practical
- No clutter or stress language in hero — lead with ease and speed
- Condo-aware: reference lifts, juristic offices, building rules naturally
- English-first but not exclusively expat — serves anyone searching in English
- No US junk removal template language (no "attic cleanout", "dumpster rental" etc.)

## Service Page Template (Tier 1)

Each Tier 1 page follows this structure:

1. H1 with primary keyword (e.g. "Furniture Removal in Bangkok")
2. Intro paragraph — 3-4 sentences, keyword-rich, Bangkok-specific
3. What we remove — specific item list
4. How it works — same 3 steps
5. Recent jobs — 2-3 relevant case studies
6. Pricing section — "how pricing works" transparency, no exact prices
7. FAQ — 4-5 service-specific questions
8. CTA — /go button + LINE + phone

### Tier 1 Page Specifics

**/furniture-removal**
- Headline: "Old Sofa, Bed, or Wardrobe? We'll Pick It Up."
- Lead with the swap scenario: "New furniture arriving? We'll take the old piece away."
- Callout box: IKEA furniture specifically — "Moving out of a Bangkok condo full of IKEA? We handle this constantly."

**/appliance-removal**
- Headline: "Old Fridge, Washing Machine, or AC? We'll Take It Away."

- Responsible disposal callout: fridges and ACs contain refrigerants — disposed of properly
- Items: fridges, washing machines, dryers, ACs, water heaters, microwaves, ovens, TVs

**/condo-clearout**
- Rename to **/property-clearout** or keep as **/condo-clearout** with broader copy
- Headline: "Full Property Clearout in Bangkok — We Handle Everything."
- Body copy should reference condos, houses, townhouses, and shophouses — not just condos
- This is the highest-priority page — most copy effort goes here
- Lead with reassurance: no judgment, no sorting required, we handle building management

**/office-clearout**

- Slightly more formal tone
- Key message: "We work around your schedule"
- Callout: Bangkok mixed-use buildings have loading dock hours and lift restrictions — we know how to handle this
- Items: desks, chairs, filing cabinets, monitors, printers, shelving, partition walls

---

## Tier 2 Page Template (lean)

Each Tier 2 page needs only:
- H1 with keyword
- 1 short paragraph
- Item/scenario list
- 3-step process (same as always)
- CTA

No FAQ, no case studies, no pricing section until the page earns it via traffic/calls.

### Tier 2 Page Notes

**/rubbish-removal** — British English variant. Targets UK, Australian, and European expats who don't use the word "junk." Headline: "Rubbish Removal in Bangkok — We'll Take It All Away." Use British English vocabulary throughout: rubbish, bulky waste, clearance, collection. Do not use American English terms (junk, trash, garbage) on this page. Same service, entirely different vocabulary.

---

## Area Page Template

Same template for every district:

1. H1: "Junk Removal in [District], Bangkok"
2. Intro: 3-4 sentences, mention district name multiple times, reference condo buildings and local context
3. Services available — same list every page
4. Real job callout if one exists — "We recently cleared a full condo at [Building], [District]" with link to case study
5. How to book — LINE, WhatsApp, phone, /go
6. CTA

---

## Internal Linking Rules

- Service pages → link to relevant area pages with anchor text "[service] in [district]"
- Area pages → link to relevant service pages with anchor text "[service] in [district]"
- Every case study / blog post → links to its relevant service page AND area page
- Homepage → links to all Tier 1 service pages and Tier A area pages

---

## Translation System

Pages are automatically translated by the platform — the builder does not need to write Thai content. However the builder must follow these rules precisely for the translation system to work:

**Rule 1 — Use the `tr` class on every translatable text element.**
Any text that should be translated must have `class="tr"` on its element. Elements without this class will not be translated.

```html
<!-- Correct -->
<h1 class="tr">Junk Removal in Bangkok</h1>
<p class="tr">We pick up old furniture and appliances across Bangkok.</p>

<!-- Wrong — will not be translated -->
<h1>Junk Removal in Bangkok</h1>
```

**Rule 2 — No HTML or special symbols inside `tr` elements.**
Text inside any element with `class="tr"` must be plain text only. No nested HTML tags, no icons, no emoji, no special characters, no `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<a>`, `<br>`, or any other markup inside the element.

```html
<!-- Correct -->
<p class="tr">Fast, affordable junk removal in Bangkok.</p>

<!-- Wrong — nested HTML inside tr element will break translation -->
<p class="tr">Fast, <strong>affordable</strong> junk removal in Bangkok.</p>
<p class="tr">Call us at <a href="tel:+66827973702">082-797-3702</a></p>
```

**Rule 3 — Split mixed content into separate elements.**
If a block contains both translatable text and non-translatable elements (like a phone number, link, or icon), split them into separate elements. Only wrap the plain text portions with `class="tr"`.

```html
<!-- Correct -->
<p class="tr">Call us anytime</p>
<a href="tel:+66827973702">082-797-3702</a>

<!-- Wrong -->
<p class="tr">Call us anytime at <a href="tel:+66827973702">082-797-3702</a></p>
```

**Rule 4 — All user-facing text must have the `tr` class.**
This includes: headings, paragraphs, card titles, card descriptions, button labels, FAQ questions and answers, form labels, placeholder text, footer text, navigation items, and meta content where applicable.

**Rule 5 — Do not add `tr` to non-text elements.**
Do not add `class="tr"` to images, icons, links (only the link text inside), phone numbers, LINE IDs, email addresses, or URLs.

## What To Reuse From Current Site

- All existing blog/case study posts — keep every one, they are valuable
- Existing testimonials (David Walker, Trevor Cardozo, Mason Doty)
- Google Reviews link
- LINE / WhatsApp / phone contact details
- Bilingual structure (EN primary, /th/ for Thai versions)

## What To Remove

- Attic cleanout page

- Bulk pickup page (too vague)
- Any other US-template service names that don't reflect Bangkok reality

---

## Service Page Item Cards

Each Tier 1 service page includes a section of ~10 cards, one per specific item or scenario. Each card has:
- Item name as the card title
- 1-2 sentence description that naturally includes the item name + "removal" or "pickup" + "Bangkok"
- Written like a human, not keyword-stuffed
- Purpose: captures long-tail searches, removes doubt about whether we take specific items

### Card SEO Notes for Builder
- Each card title is an H3
- Description naturally includes item + removal/pickup + Bangkok at least once
- Do not force keywords — write naturally
- Cards section headline: "What We Remove" or "Items We Pick Up"
- Cards should be visually scannable — icon or simple illustration per card if possible

---

## Property Types Section (Reusable Partial)

**Build as a reusable partial** — include on the homepage (after the Services section) and on every Tier 1 service page (after the item cards). One component, used everywhere. Do not duplicate the code.

**Section headline:** "We Serve All Property Types in Bangkok"

**6 cards:**

1. **Condo & Apartment** — High-rise or low-rise, we know Bangkok building rules, lifts, and juristic offices inside out.
2. **House & Villa** — Larger jobs, bigger volumes, no problem. We bring the right team and truck size for the job.
3. **Townhouse** — Multi-floor pickups handled efficiently. We navigate stairs and tight spaces without damaging your property.
4. **Shophouse** — Clearing decades of accumulated stock, equipment, or furniture from a shophouse is a job we do regularly.
5. **Office & Commercial** — From single-room offices to full floor clearouts, we work around your business hours.
6. **Landed Estate** — Large properties with significant volume. We scale the team and number of trips to match the job.

**Placement:**
- Homepage: after the Services section
- Tier 1 service pages: after the item cards section
- Tier 2 service pages: omit (keep those pages lean)
- Area pages: omit

**SEO note:** This section naturally seeds property-type keywords (condo, house, townhouse, shophouse, villa) across every major page without duplication. No extra optimization needed — just make sure the card titles are H3s.

## Resource Lists (20 Articles)

Resource lists are the primary content strategy for the blog. They outperform how-to posts because they are evergreen, attract natural backlinks, capture research-phase search intent, and are heavily cited by LLMs. Every resource must be genuinely researched and verified before publishing — addresses, phone numbers, hours, and URLs confirmed at time of publication.

**Editorial rules for every resource list:**
- Minimum 8-10 verified entries per list
- Each entry must include: name, address, phone or LINE, hours, and 2-3 sentences of genuine description
- No entries included based on assumption — call or visit to verify if needed
- Add a "Last verified" date at the top of each article
- Schedule a quarterly review to check for closures or changes
- Write in a helpful, neutral tone — do not promote Bangkok Junk within the list itself (a single contextual CTA at the end is fine)
- Each article should target a specific search query — confirm the keyword has real search volume before writing

**Internal linking rule:** Every resource list must link naturally to at least one relevant service page. Example: the mattress shops list links to /mattress-removal. The storage facilities list links to /condo-clearout. This is how resource content feeds service page authority.

**Include hero CTAs on:**
- Home
- All Tier 1 service pages
- All Tier 2 service pages

**Implementation notes:**
- Buttons must be real tappable size on mobile (minimum 48px height)

The design follows the same structural aesthetic as the Khun Clean Elite site — the builder should use that as the reference for quality bar and layout approach. The fonts are identical. The colors are different to clearly distinguish Bangkok Junk as a separate brand.

### Fonts (identical to Khun Clean Elite — do not change)

Google Fonts URL to use verbatim:
`https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cormorant+Garamond:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,500;0,600;1,300;1,400&family=Montserrat:wght@300;400;500;600&display=swap`

- **Display / Headlines:** Cormorant Garamond — fallback: Georgia, serif
- **Body / UI / Nav:** Montserrat — fallback: system-ui, sans-serif

**Exact type specs (from computed styles on Elite site):**

| Element | Font | Weight | Size | Letter Spacing | Transform |
|---------|------|--------|------|----------------|-----------|
| H1 | Cormorant Garamond | 300 | clamp-scaled | -0.9px | none |
| H2 | Cormorant Garamond | 300 | — | -0.75px | none |
| H3 | Cormorant Garamond | 300 | — | — | none |
| Body / p | Montserrat | 300 | 18px | normal | none |
| Nav links | Montserrat | 500 | 12px | 2.4px | uppercase |
| Buttons | Montserrat | 300–500 | 14px | 1.5px | uppercase |
| Labels / tags | Montserrat | 500 | 11–12px | 2px+ | uppercase |

**Important:** Headlines use weight 300 (light) — this is intentional and creates the elegant, refined feel. Do not use bold or semibold for H1/H2/H3.

### Layout & Structure

**Hero section:**
- Full-width, deep slate background
- All content centered
- Thin copper horizontal rule above headline (40px wide, centered)
- Thin copper gradient line across the very top of the hero (1px, fades left and right)
- Large serif headline (Cormorant Garamond), white
- Subtext in Inter, white 70%
- Price anchor: bordered pill, copper border and text
- Three CTA buttons: Book (copper fill), LINE (brand green fill), WhatsApp (transparent with white border, turns WhatsApp green on hover)
- Contact line, trust tagline, stars, Thai link — all centered below CTAs
- No background images, textures, or gradients in hero — flat deep slate only

**Trust bar:**
- Sits immediately below hero
- Slate Light background, slightly lighter than hero
- Five trust items centered in a row, small copper dots as separators
- Inter font, small, white 70%

**Content sections:**
- Warm White background
- Max width 1100px centered
- Generous padding top and bottom (80px)
- Section labels: Inter, uppercase, letter-spaced, copper color
- Section titles: Cormorant Garamond, large, ink color
- Thin copper rule (40px) below section title, centered

**Cards:**
- White background, light border, 8px border radius
- Hover: subtle box shadow lift, no color change
- Card titles: Cormorant Garamond
- Card body: Inter
- CTA links inside cards: copper color, uppercase, letter-spaced

**Navigation:**
- Deep slate background, sticky
- Logo: Inter bold, white — "Bangkok Junk" with "/ Removal" in copper, light weight
- Nav links: Inter, uppercase, letter-spaced, white 70%
- Contact/Book button: copper fill, slate text, small, rounded 4px
- Thai flag for language toggle (flag emoji or SVG — no favicon-style icons)
- Height: 60px

### What To Avoid
- **No favicon** — do not include a favicon link tag. Favicons cheapen the overall site aesthetic.
- No gradients, noise textures, glows, or decorative effects
- No drop shadows on hero elements
- No rounded corners larger than 8px anywhere
- No emoji anywhere on the site — not in body content, not in cards, not in CTAs, not in hero. This includes decorative emoji like 🛋️ 📦 ✓ etc. Use text, icons, or SVGs only.
- Thai flag for language toggle: use SVG flag, not emoji
- No stock photo illustration style imagery — real job photos only
- No Inter for headlines — Cormorant Garamond for all H1/H2/H3 only
- No colored backgrounds on content sections other than Warm White and Off White

### Photo Treatment
- Real job photos and team photos only — no stock imagery
- Photos in content sections: 8px border radius, no border, no shadow
- Photos should be displayed large and confident — let the real work speak
- Aspect ratio 4:3 for portrait job cards, 16:9 for wide hero/section photos

### Overall Aesthetic Reference

**Fetch and review this site before building anything:** https://www.khuncleanelite.com

Khun Clean Elite is the reference for quality, structure, and feel. The builder should fetch the site, review the hero layout, nav, content sections, typography, and card components, then apply the same structural DNA to Bangkok Junk with the slate + copper color palette substituted for Elite's navy + gold.

Key things to observe on the Elite site:
- Full-width dark hero, all content centered, generous vertical padding
- Thin gold rule above the headline (replicate in copper)
- Cormorant Garamond weight 300 for all headlines — note how light and elegant it reads
- Montserrat weight 300 for body, weight 500 for nav links and labels
- Cream/warm white content area below the hero
- Section structure: uppercase label → large serif title → thin rule → content
- Card components: white background, subtle border, clean hover state
- No decorative effects, no gradients, no shadows on hero elements
- Overall: restrained, professional, premium without being cold
